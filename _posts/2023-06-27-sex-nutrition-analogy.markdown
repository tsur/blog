# Introduction

Being a parent is a great experience full of challenges. When kids start getting big kids and they start showing a natural interest on sexuality, parents must be ready to teach them about it in a natural, easy, informal, relaxed way. 

As a father, mother, or a close relative, this is not always an easy topic to talk about, specially if you just did not have any education about it from your own parents or family. In this post I would like to share with you, specially if you are papa or mama, a possible way to address this topic so you get ready when they become teenagers. This is my own methodology, but I think it has worked for me pretty well so hope it also does for you!


# Building the nutrition pyramid exercise

I first starting talking about food and nutrition as this is a quite familiar, informal and easy to understand topic to talk with teenagers, and... it is also a good opportunity to teach them about nutrition!

The exercise is about building a nutrition pyramid. What kind of food do you think is the most unhealthy one and what the most healthy one? What is the food you like the most and you hate the most? Or just rate this foods according to how healthy do you think it is ...You can think about different variants of the same exercise, just let your imagination goes and adapt to what you think is best for your kids according to it ages and personalities.

Ask them to write down some examples of different type of meals in post-its with different colors and ask them to order from most unhealthy to most healthy. Ask them also to order the meals by most tasty and most disgusting. Take all the time you need and try to make this fun. It should not take longer than 45 minutes.

After the exercise is done. I show them my own nutrition pyramid and take the opportunity to dive deep on it finally get to something like this

This goes from just steroids, tablets, all kind of non real-food additives or suplements to the most high quaility food. We spend some time discussing about the different levels with different examples and then it is the time when I start connecitng and teaching them about sexuality as something similar to food and nutrition: Sexuality is something we need in the similar way than we need to eat and have a good diet. This is a great opportunity to teach them about the risks of an unhealthy sexuality just as the risk of an unhealthy nutrition.

# Building the sexuality pyramid exercise

Ok, the fun part. Now repeat the same exercise we did about food but this time about sexuality and here we have a very funny time as they try to think and make all this work in their heads about the sexuality pyramid and what the hell would be an unhealthy or healthy sexuality for them

After some minutes we all have shared our own sexuality pyramid and I present them with mine's one (of course you can build a different one than mine's):

Let's see what each level means from bottom to top:

* Level 0 - 
* Level 1 -
* Level 2 -
* Level 3 -
* Level 4 -
* Level 5 -
* Level 6 -
* Level 7 - 

# Conclusion

I think overall this is a good and funny exercise, but very important to educate and teach your kids about the importance of a good and healthy sexuality when they become teenagers and young adults.

Hope this is useful for you too!
