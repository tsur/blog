Being a parent is a great experience full of challenges. When kids start getting big kids and they start showing a natural interest on sexuality, parents must be ready to teach them about it in a natural, easy, informal, relaxed way. 

As a father, mother, or a close relative, I know this is not always an easy topic to talk about, specially if you just did not have any education about it from your own parents or family. In this post I would like to share with you, specially if you are papa or mama, a possible way to address this topic so you get ready when they become teenagers. This is my own methodology, but I think it has worked for me pretty well so hope it also does for you!

I first starting talking about food and nutrition as this is a quite familiar, informal and easy to understand topic to talk with teenagers, and... it is also a good opportunity to teach them about nutrition!

We ask them to make an exercise about nutrition. This is about building the nutrition pyramid. What food do you think is the most unhealthy one and what the most healthy one? 

Ask them to write down some examples of different type of meals in post-its with different colors and ask them to order from most unhealthy to most healthy. Ask them also to order the meals by most tasty and most disgusting. Take all the time you need and try to make this fun. It should not take longer than 45 minutes.

After the exercise is done. I show them my own nutrition pyramid and take the opportunity to deep dive on it until I get to something like this
