# Introduction

Being a parent is a great experience full of challenges. When kids start getting big kids and they start showing a natural interest on sexuality, parents must be ready to teach them about it in a natural, easy, informal, relaxed way. 

As a father, mother, or a close relative, I know this is not always an easy topic to talk about, specially if you just did not have any education about it from your own parents or family. In this post I would like to share with you, specially if you are papa or mama, a possible way to address this topic so you get ready when they become teenagers. This is my own methodology, but I think it has worked for me pretty well so hope it also does for you!

# Building the nutrition pyramid exercise

I first starting talking about food and nutrition as this is a quite familiar, informal and easy to understand topic to talk with teenagers, and... it is also a good opportunity to teach them about nutrition!

We ask them to make an exercise about nutrition. This is about building the nutrition pyramid. What food do you think is the most unhealthy one and what the most healthy one? 

Ask them to write down some examples of different type of meals in post-its with different colors and ask them to order from most unhealthy to most healthy. Ask them also to order the meals by most tasty and most disgusting. Take all the time you need and try to make this fun. It should not take longer than 45 minutes.

After the exercise is done. I show them my own nutrition pyramid and take the opportunity to deep dive on it until I get to something like this

This goes from just steroids, tablets, all kind of non real-food additives to the most high quaility food. We spend some time discussing about the different levels with different examples and then it is the time when I start conencitng and teaching them about sexuality as something similar to food and nutrition. Sexuality is something we need in the similar way than we need to eat. This is a great opportunity to teach them about the risks of an unhealthy sexuality just as like an unhealthy nutrition

# Building the sexuality pyramid exercise

We therefore repeat the same exercise we did about food but this time about sexuality and here we have a very funny time as they try to think and make all this work in their heads about the sexuality pyramid and what the hell would be an unhealthy or healthy sexuality for them

After some minutes we all have shared our own sexuality pyramid and I present them with mine's one:

Let's see what each level means from bottom to top:

* Level 0 - 
* Level 1 -
* Level 2 -
* Level 3 -
* Level 4 -
* Level 5 -
* Level 6 -
* Level 7 - 

# Conclusion

I think overall this is a good and funny exercise, but very important to educate and teach your kids about the importance of a good and healthy sexuality when they become teenagers and young adults.

Hope this is useful for you too!
