# Introduction

Being a parent is a great experience full of challenges. When kids start getting big kids and they start showing a natural interest on sexuality, parents must be ready to teach them about it in a natural, easy, informal, relaxed way. 

As a father, mother, or a close relative, this is not always an easy topic to talk about, specially if you just did not have any education about it from your own parents or family. In this post I would like to share with you, specially if you are papa or mama, a possible way to address this topic so you get ready when they become teenagers. This is my own methodology, but I think it has worked for me pretty well so hope it also does for you!


# Building the nutrition pyramid exercise

I first start talking about food and nutrition as this is a quite familiar, informal and easy to understand topic to talk with teenagers, and... it is also a good opportunity to teach them about nutrition!

The exercise is about building a nutrition pyramid. What kind of food do you think is the most unhealthy one and what the most healthy one? What is the food you like the most and you hate the most? Or just rate this foods according to how healthy do you think it is ...You can think about different variants of the same exercise, just let your imagination goes and adapt to what you think is best for your kids according to it ages and personalities.

Ask them to write down some examples of different type of meals in post-its with different colors and ask them to order from most unhealthy to most healthy. Ask them also to order the meals by most tasty and most disgusting. Take all the time you need and try to make this fun. It should not take longer than 45 minutes.

After the exercise is done. I show them my own nutrition pyramid and take the opportunity to dive deep on it to finally get something like this

This goes from just steroids, tablets, all kind of non real-food additives or suplements to the most high quaility food. We spend some time discussing about the different levels with different examples and then it is the time when I start connecitng and teaching them about sexuality as something similar to food and nutrition: Sexuality is something we need in the similar way than we need to eat and have a good diet. This is a great opportunity to teach them about the risks of an unhealthy sexuality just as the risk of an unhealthy nutrition.

# Building the sexuality pyramid exercise

Ok, the fun part. Now repeat the same exercise we did about food but this time about sexuality and here we have a very funny time as they try to think and make all this work in their heads about the sexuality pyramid and what the hell would be an unhealthy or healthy sexuality for them

After taking enough time to make the exercise, let everyone present its own version of the sexuality pyramid. Discuss and make several open question rounds to deep dive on it as you did with the nutrition pyramid exercise. display yours too and finally make a side by side comparison between the nutrition pyramid and the sexuality pyramid.

Below is mine's version (of course you can build a different one):

[![sexuality pyramid](https://zuripabon.es/blog/assets/sexuality-pyramid.png)](https://zuripabon.es/blog/assets/sexuality-pyramid.png)

I will not cover in details the reasons but let's see briefly what each level means from bottom (most unhealthy) to top (most healthy):

* Level 0 - This is the most harmful, unhealthy level which in my opinion corresponds to explicit porn in all its different variants. As in nutrition, this would correspon to whatever, steroids, additives, and all kind of "non-real" food, including also ultra processed food since it comes already "processed" and you have nothing to do but to consume it. The quality of nutrients and the quality of the sexuality here is extremely low and dangerous in the long term because you will miss the "sexuality" nutrients and your sexual experience will be quite poor and limited

* Level 1 - Next in the rating is actually not developing your sexuality at all like in the case of making an everlasting vow of chastity. In the same way as not eating at all will eventually get you to death, this will completely kill your sexuality which is a very important aspect of yourself affecting other areas of your personal and spiritual development. It could be ok for some time to stay in this pyramid level just like sometimes we decide to not eat during some specific period of time to recover from a disease or just as a fasting practice which has really good beenfits for the body when done properly

* Level 2 - In the next level of our sexuality pyramid I include the "soft, non-explicit" porn. This is for example a person behaving in a sensual way, undressing, but without explicit intercourse scenes. It could be compared as to ultra processed and processed food in the nutrition pyramid. In this level you start interacting and developing your sexuality with your imagination and starts incorporating sutile creative energies, but just during a small part as the remaining time is basically just "consuming", as if it is ultra-processed food.

* Level 3 - This level correspond to the physical intercourse between two people driven by pure passion and desire without anything else. No love, no emotions, nothing else than pure physical attraction desire. This is very similar to the previous one, but here the level of integration, interaction, imaginative, creative exchange of healthy thoughts and emotions is higher than in the previous level as the physical interaction and efforts required are also higher. It could be understood as the transition from ultra-processed food to processed food.

* Level 4 - The practice of healthy masturbation with no elements incorporated from the previous levels. Here the quality of emotions, self-awareness, imaginative, creative processes starts taking relevance. We could compare this as non processed food like nutritive home-made food, but the quality and the amount of this nutrients is still very limited to be considered as low quality non processed food.

* Level 5 - Intercourse on the base of a healthy relationship with your partner. There is a strong commitment on both sides to keep a healthy relationship, but the aspects driving the sexual practices are mainly the same as in the previus two levels, a cocktail of physical attraction and some positive emotions. It can be considered as the mix of the two previous levels. Compared to nutrition, see it as partially home-made food, partially processed food. Still some of sugar and other posions in the food.

* Level 6 - The evolution of the previous level 5. In this step the relationship is not driven by just physical attraction or ephemeral emotions, but includes a deep, profound integration process which starts emanating from the acceptation of the good and the bads, trying to understand every aspect and taking the most of it. At times, it feels like they are not anymore two different people but one. This would be the end of processed unhealthy food, with a high awareness of what it means a healthy and a unhealthy relationship.

* Level 7 - This is possible beyond of 90% human beings and possibly just something going around on my own thoughts but for me this level would be the most high quality one. The difference from the previous one is the full integration, in all aspects, physically, emotionally, mentally but also spiritually. They become one and the same being. As in nuclear fusion, when two atomic nuclei fuse together and release an immense torrent of creative, healing, powerful energy. They are no longer two, they are one. This is also the best level and moment to bring children into the world, because they will absorb and manifest later this beautiful torrent of infinite energy to the world.

# Conclusion

I think overall this is a good and funny exercise, but very important to educate and teach your kids about the importance of a good and healthy sexuality when they become teenagers and young adults.

Hope this is useful for you too!
