### Prologue

It was like a sudden awakening, difficult and confusing at times, but refreshing and enlightening in the end.

"Mother, today is the day of the promotion," Anane said joyfully as he was assisting me.

The atmosphere in the room was warm and subdued, briefly illuminated by a violet iridescence. From the window, I could see a beautiful orange sunrise. My uniform, a one-piece garment in deep black obsidian, absorbed the vibrant violet and golden hues that filled the room all over around, as if prisoners denied them the freedom to reflect and radiate their warm and beautiful hues.

"Today is the day we have been waiting for, Anane. You will finally descend. This will be your first awakening, the most beautiful and exciting of all that will come after."

"Do we already know the destination?" Anane asked, revealing her slightly crooked teeth.

This time, the promotion ceremony for new volunteers was taking place at alpha-52, the brightest and most beautiful star in our galactic sector.

Anane had served me well. He was a good boy, slim in appearance, and with a remarkable peaceful energy. Among his ancestors were great artists and some renowned scientists who had contributed significant achievements to our old and advanced holographic society. Although Anane did not excel in any specific area of knowledge, he had achieved notable progress and development in those fields where his most notable ancestors had rarely achieved better results.

He had just completed his first service cycle, that is his first major service was coming to an end and soon, I would no longer be his first mother, and Anane would cease to be my child. I was lately feeling as if I could have done more to assist Anane and that feeling was growing deep inside me.

"Pay attention, Anane. Today is the day of your promotion. You will become a new volunteer, and from that moment on, you will no longer be my child. Before that happens later, I would like you to keep this with yourself. It has been a ancient family gem. One of the pieces my family lineage has kept for ages and now also yours. I'm no longer a volunteer, but you can still find the missing pieces and bring back to life this ancient volunteer. Go keep it safe, and get ready for the promotion ceremony."

I had a special affection for this gem. It was the first one I found in the colonization operations when I was younger. But despite all my efforts, I could never communicate with it. Its thought energies remained very dense, with almost no movement, and the only known way to bring them back to life was through smelting.

When gems were melted, their thought energies became lighter, escaping the density and taking on new forms. However, this was an especially painful and traumatic process for the thought energies. And without other gems to complete the missing thought energies, smelting would yield no results, only bringing more pain and suffering. So we could only resort to smelting when we had numerous gems of the same nature. And I had only one. But this time, who knows, perhaps Anane would have better luck than me.

Anane: “Thank you Mother. My beginning and my end. You can trust I shall keep and protect this gem to the end of my days and shall serve this gem with love and dedication or shall pass the torch to those who come after me if I fail. This gem will not be forgotten. If I may, I would like to name this gem same as yours, Mother”

I nodded my head in approval to Anane's request while I looked again at the now reddish sky, stained like blood, and remembered my first mother. She had a fierce and imposing appearance, but her energy was gentle and calm. Her energy emitted vibrant and penetrating colors, and her rhythm was smooth and unhurried. One can never forget the first mother; its imprint and strength are engraved in your soul forever.

My thoughts about Zeniza, my first mother, took my back to the events that marked the beginning of the colonies of the ancient volunteers, how they gradually descended into the lower realities, eons ago. These ancient volunteers were the founders of new worlds, bringing light where there was only darkness, confusion, and disorder.

The risks they took were immense, and many of them perished in service to knowledge, wisdom, and the expansion of everything, our beloved and eternal singular principle. They were absorbed by those uncertain realities, just as my one-piece deep black obsidian uniform absorbed the beautiful and warm colors of that blood-stained morning I was looking at through the window — colors that timidly and innocently dared to touch the fine and delicate mesh of deep black thread fabric, never to escape it again.

The volunteers departed in large groups to those unknown lower realities. Many of them were lost forever in the depths of those unknown realities. Even to these days, many ancient volunteers are still lost, emitting a faint pulse, in perpetual hibernation, awaiting the moment when other volunteers will reach them wherever they may be found and awaken them from their long and harsh slumber. 

All we know they managed to do in order to protect themselves from those relentless realities was to harden their thought energies to such an extreme they would become extremely rigid. We called them gems. Beautiful crystals carrying inside them the knowledge and experience of the ancient volunteers.

My world was one of many others to be colonized. Many realities stand above ours, and many others, closer to ours, are still in the process of colonization. As I watched Anane, I remembered my first descent into our nearest lower reality. The thought energies there were denser, heavier, darker, with slow movements, a toxic reality for our delicate thought energies, but also a reality full of new experiences to learn from.

In our higher reality, it is often said that the ultimate purpose of existence for beings and their thought energies is nothing more than their own expansion, and that is precisely what these lower realities offer us.

Our nearest lower reality was already in an advanced state of colonization. So Anane would adapt quickly to it. The volunteers never fully descend into a lower reality until their thought energies reach the level of maturity and necessary adaptation to project themselves into the mold that contains them within the lower reality. We called this mold the body.

To facilitate the projection of our thought energies into the molds, the ancient volunteers separated the thought energies into opposing polarities that would attract each other based on their frequency attributes, and when joined tight together, would form the structure of a new mold to hold other similar thought energies. The moment of bonding is the most astounding, an extremely enriching and pleasurable experience, but also filled with unpredictable risks.

Projecting into a lower reality requires intense preparation. This preparation is the volunteers' first great service and spans across multiple ages. The candidates to volunteers learn to master their base frequency, allowing them to descend or ascend at will to a lower reality in a simulated experience. But when simulation is over and volunteers truly descend, even the slightest imbalance would have fatal consequences. 

That is why we never bring with us our memories during the first descent into a lower reality. They remain intact in our original reality, and it is only when we have fully mastered the descent technique that we can bring them with us. So, during our initial awakening in the lower realities, we remember nothing of who we are. It is the most important job a mother was in charge of. Taking care of the volunteer child memories and assisting during that hard moments when the volunteer remembers nothing about its own existence. It was my last pending job with Anane untill he could dominate the technique and bring its memories with himself without my assistence.

It was a painful lesson for the ancient volunteers to learn. They were unaware of it at the very beginning, and many of them suffered greatly from not being able to remember all the details of their origins. Not all of them were affected to the same degree at the same time. 

Those volunteers who managed to maintain and preserve their less fragmented memories took care of their fellow volunteers who completely lost their memories. They tried to fill in the gaps in their memories, and thus, the belief emerged for the first time because they had no way to validate the information. When the affected volunteers returned to their original reality, gradually, they regained their memories as consciousness regenerated them in the higher realities, as if it were a wound slowly healing.

Despite the advanced state of colonization in our lower reality, its density literally crushed our thought energies, causing them to fragment over time, like a beautiful mirror slowly wearing down and cracking into hundreds of thousands of small pieces. So, at regular intervals, when our thought energies fragmented and broke apart, we had to return home to recover. Our thought energies were highly calibrated before our descent to return back home after a critic threshold was reached. And we called this process death.

While I was still thinking on this all. Anane fixed his gaze on me, deeply intrigued, as if trying to find the key to a hidden treasure and asked. "Shall I descend after we return back from the promotion ceremony, Mother?"

"That will depend on how good or bad you perform at the promotion ceremony final test. And talking about the ceremony, it is time to depart. I firmly trust on your good performance and never forget I will be there on your side to assist you, my child"

Anane: "Mother, please, grant me with the privilege of taking you with me to the ceremony hall"


It is common for us to travel using technological means through portals or spaceships. However, it is a tradition for the ceremony day to let volunteer candidates travel using a extremely dangerous and risky technique. This is one of the hardest and most important technique all volunteers have to dominate before the time to descend comes for them

"My beginning and my end" I said Anane in a sign of approval as I trasmited the frequency of the ceremony audience hall coordinates in alpha-52 from the stellar maps right into the Anane's thought energies

There are two different ways to travel. In one, you move towards the destination, and in the other, the destination moves towards you

At that moment, Anane fixed his eyes on mine, large and of a deep violet-blue color, as if by instinctive reflection, and join our hands together. Anane fully concentrated and ordered its thoughts energies to get excited to the destination frequency. 

A few moments later, while we were still staring directly into each other's eyes, the splendid audience hall of the promotion ceremony in alpha-52 began to take shape in Anane's large and deep blue eyes, and everything around us seemed to merge into a soft and welcoming pale light.

An instant later, we were in the audience hall of Alpha-52; the destination had come to us.

To be continue...
