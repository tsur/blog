Prologue

It was like a sudden awakening, difficult and confusing at times, but refreshing and enlightening in the end.

"Mother, today is the day of the promotion," Anane said joyfully as he was assisting me.

The atmosphere in the room was warm and subdued, briefly illuminated by a violet iridescence. From the window, I could see a beautiful orange sunset. My uniform, a one-piece garment in deep black obsidian, absorbed the vibrant violet and golden hues that filled the room all over around, as if prisoners denied them the freedom to reflect and radiate their warm and beautiful hues.

"Today is the day we have been waiting for, Anane. You will finally descend. This will be your first awakening, the most beautiful and exciting of all that will come after."

"Do we already know the destination?" Anane asked, revealing her slightly crooked teeth.

This time, the promotion ceremony for new volunteers was taking place at alpha-52, the brightest and most beautiful star in our galactic sector.

Anane had served me well. He was a good boy, slim in appearance, and with a remarkable protective energy. Among her ancestors were great artists and some renowned scientists who had contributed significant achievements to our old and advanced holographic society. Although Anane did not excel in any specific area of knowledge, he had achieved notable progress and development in those fields where his most notable ancestors had rarely achieved better results.

He had just completed his first service cycle, that is his first major service was coming to an end and soon, I would no longer be his first mother, and Anane would cease to be my first child. I was lately feeling as if I could have done more to assist Anane and that feeling was growing deep inside me.

"Pay attention, Anane. Today is the day of your promotion. You will become a new volunteer, and from that moment on you will no longer be my child. Before that happens later, I would like to teach you something important that you might need in your new stage of service as a volunteer. But first, tidy everything up for when we return from the promotion ceremony, please."

While Anane finished preparing everything, I looked again at the now reddish sky, stained like blood, and remembered my first mother. She had a fierce and imposing appearance, but her energy was gentle and calm. Her energy emitted vibrant and penetrating colors, and her rhythm was smooth and unhurried. You can never forget your first mother; her imprint and energy are engraved in your soul forever. And although I didn't know it at that moment, I would never be a mother again.

My thoughts kept returning to the events that marked the beginning of the colonies of the ancient volunteers, how they gradually descended into the only reality I knew during my first service, ages ago. These ancient volunteers were the founders of new worlds, bringing light where there was only darkness, confusion, and disorder.

The risks they took were immense, and many of them perished in service to knowledge, wisdom, and the expansion of everything, our beloved and eternal singular principle. They were absorbed by those uncertain realities, just as my one-piece deep black obsidian uniform absorbed the beautiful and warm colors of that blood-stained evening I was looking at through the window—colors that timidly and innocently dared to touch the fine and delicate mesh of thread fabric, never to escape it again.

The volunteers departed in large groups to those unknown lower realities. Many of them were lost forever in the depths of the singular principle. Even to this day, many of those lost ancient volunteers emit a faint pulse, keeping them in perpetual hibernation, awaiting the moment when other volunteers will reach them wherever they may be found and awaken them from their long and harsh slumber. All we know they managed to do in order to protect themselves from those relentless realities was to harden their thought energies to such an extreme they would become extremely rigid. We called them gems. Beautiful crystals carrying inside them the knowledge and experience of the ancient volunteers.

My world was one of many others to be colonized. Many realities stand above ours, and many others, close to ours, are still in the process of colonization. As I watched Anane, I remembered my first descent into our lower reality. The thought energies there were denser, heavier, darker, with slow movements—a toxic reality for our delicate thought energies, but also a reality full of new experiences to learn from. In our higher reality, it is often said that the ultimate purpose of existence for beings and their thought energies is nothing more than their own expansion, and that is precisely what these lower realities offer us.

Our nearest lower reality was already in an advanced state of colonization. So Anane will adapt quickly. The volunteers never fully descend into a lower reality until their thought energies reach the level of maturity and necessary adaptation to project themselves into the mold that contains them within the lower reality. We called this mold the body.

To facilitate the projection of our thought energies into the molds, the ancient volunteers separated the thought energies into opposing polarities that would attract each other based on their frequency attributes, and when joined tight together, would form the structure of a new mold to hold new thought energies. The moment of bonding is the most astounding, an extremely enriching and pleasurable experience, but also filled with unpredictable risks.

Projecting into a lower reality requires intense preparation. This preparation is the volunteers' first great service and spans across multiple ages. The candidates to volunteers learn to master their base frequency, allowing them to descend or ascend at will to a lower reality in a simulated experience. But when simulation is over and volunteers truly descend, even the slightest imbalance would have fatal consequences. 

That is why our memories never accompany us during the first descent into a lower reality. They remain intact in our original reality, and it is only when we have fully mastered the descent technique that we can bring them with us. So, during our initial awakening in the lower realities, we remember nothing of who we are. Even after mastering the technique, this practice is common to avoid accidents during the process.

It was a painful lesson for the ancient volunteers to learn. They were unaware of it at the very beginning, and many of them suffered greatly from not being able to remember all the details of their origins. Not all of them were affected to the same degree either at the same time. Those volunteers who managed to maintain and preserve their less fragmented memories took care of their fellow volunteers. They tried to fill in the gaps in their memories, and thus, the belief emerged for the first time because they had no way to validate the information. When the affected volunteers returned to their original reality, gradually, they regained their memories as consciousness regenerated them in the higher realities, as if it were a wound slowly healing.

Despite the advanced state of colonization in our lower reality, its density literally crushed our thought energies, causing them to fragment over time, like a beautiful mirror slowly wearing down and cracking into hundreds of thousands of small pieces. So, at regular intervals, when our thought energies fragmented and broke apart, we had to return home to recover. And we called this process death.

"Everything is ready and tidy, Mother." Anane replied. "Come closer, Anane. You are about to learn something important before the promotion ceremony. Remember this, there are two different ways to travel. In one, you move towards the destination, and in the other, the destination moves towards you." 

Anane fixed his gaze on me, deeply intrigued, as if trying to find the key to a hidden treasure.

Until today, you had only traveled using technological means through portals or ships. But you have finished your first service and are now capable of controlling the frequency changes of your thought energies. Let me show you Anane.

"I will record the dinamic frequency range inputs from the stellar map of the audience hall in Alpha-52 right into your visual sensors. When you are ready, try to excite your thought energies to that same frequency. Keep adjusting them till they both make a match. Take my hand. This time I will travel along with you"

At that moment, Anane fixed his eyes even more on mine, large and of a deep violet-blue color, as if by instinctive reflection. A few moments later, the splendid audience hall of the promotion ceremony in Alpha-52 began to take shape in Anane's large and deep blue eyes, while everything around us seemed to merge into a soft and welcoming pale light.

An instant later, we were in the audience hall of Alpha-52; the destination had come to us.
