This is my personal blog where I sometimes share some of my ideas, thoughts, discoverings or even failures. I do love programming and maths related topics, so you might expect reading posts about them most of the time. But I'd like to make this space a place for writting down about anything I find interesting and useful as I go across the flatlands of my day-to-day life.
